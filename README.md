This study examines how to detect depression using physical activity data from wearable actigraphy devices. Using an openly available dataset, the analysis begins with summary statistics and behavioral feature extraction: average activity, standard deviation, maximum activity, and total activity per day. An independent two-sample t-test confirmed that depressed individuals demonstrated significantly lower average daily activity compared to healthy controls (t = -3.41, p < .001). Machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost were evaluated using reproducible participant level splits (60:20:20 train/validation/test ratio). After hyperparameter optimization with Optuna, all three algorithms achieved comparable test performance, with macro F1 scores between 0.63 and 0.70 and ROC AUC values between 0.75 and 0.79. Random Forest obtained the highest macro F1 score of 0.70, while Logistic Regression and Random Forest both achieved the highest ROC AUC of 0.79, indicating good overall discrimination despite class imbalance. These features help differentiate between healthy and depressed participants. This supports the use of sensor-based analytics in mental health research.
